# PortXel
This is my first portfolio website project built using React and Tailwind. 
It took me about three weeks to complete since Iâ€™m still learning React and Tailwind, so I needed some time to adjust.
Moving forward, I plan to add on-scroll animations and more features, like database integration, to make it more functional and improve the mobile experience.
